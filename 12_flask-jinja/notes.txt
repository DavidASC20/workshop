Predictions/Notes

Q0: Removing the render_template from the import will make the test_templt function
break, because the function calls render_template, and without it the function
will not be able to run.

Q1: We predict the url to load the page would be https://localhost:5000/my_foist_template"

Q2:The first parameter is the filename of the template.  The named parameters
"foo" and "collection" will be used as variables in the template files, and the {{ foo }} in the template
will be replaced with "fooooo" and the {% for item in collection %} will use the
list {0,1,1,2,3,5,8}

Notes:
The model_tmplt.html file contains {%for item in collection %} which seems
related to python's for loop, and {%endfor%} is the end of the loop.
