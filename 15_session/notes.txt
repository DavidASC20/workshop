K14 -- Form and Function
2021-10-14

Observation from console for 14
- In console there's error method about not finding the icon. 
- In the network section there's similar information with what's being printed in the console by flask everytime we reload. 
- We can see how the program uses memory in the memory section by taking a snapshot
- Inspector allow us to mess around with the html on the site. 


Plan on writing code
- To start, we have login.html and app.py from HW 14
- Need to make a conditional
- Three different ways it can pan out, wrong username, wrong password, and correct
- Need the response.html to have a variable for the string returned
- If wrong user, return username not found
- Else If wrong pass, return password not found
- Else, return welcome message
- SIDE NOTE, obv this wont work with an actual website, most say passworrd and or username is unrecognized,
but for the homework, since it is hardcoded, that is what we should do.
- Need error handling for different ways people could send in the requests(?) bit unsure of this and error handling in general.
