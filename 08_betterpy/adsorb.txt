Questions 
I had a question for Sophies code, as I didnt really understand why she read the files in the way that she did, and I am not really sure on how the split function works
Comments
I liked the simplicity of Sophie's code, and I liked how simplistic her print statement was
I liked that Jessie actually coded out the weighted portion, as seeing it in code made it easier to understand, instead of just using a function.
Concerns
Im wonderirng if the goal of looking at other peoples work is to see their thought processes while they are coding, or to learn shortcuts that you could use yourself.  Maybe a little bit of both?
