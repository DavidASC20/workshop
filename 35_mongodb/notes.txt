Modeling for RDBMS
Step 1: Define Schema

Step 2: Develop application and queries

Data dictates how you develop your application, work around the data.
As data model evolves, performance drops.




Data Modeling with MongoDB
1. Develop the application
2. Define the Data Model
3. Improve the application
4. Improve the Data Model

Last 2 steps compliment each other, as one improves, the other should improve with it.
Allows the way you use your date to dictate how it is stored, provides many design options.
- Many design options
- Designed for the usage pattern
- Data model evolution is easy
- Can evolve wihtout any downtime


Data model is defined at the application level.
Design is part of each phase of the application lifetime
The data that your application needs and the applications read and write usage of the data affect the data model 





Step by Step Iteration of the Data Model
- Evaluate the application workload(potential application workload, Business domain expertise, Current and predicted scenario, Production logs and Stats)
Data size
List of operations ranked by importance
- Map out entities and their relationships
gets CRD: Collection relationship Diagram

- Finalize the data model for each Collection
Identify and apply relevant design patterns

Final Product: 
Collections with documents fields and shapes for each
Data size
Database queries and indexes
Current operations assumptions and growth projections





Link or Embed?
    Relationships:
    One-to-one
    One-to-Many
    Many-to-Many

    One to One
    Linking - Linking two separate things
    Embed - Embedding one thing into the opther to make them part of the same

    One to Many
    can link parent to child or child to parent
    ex: link all books in authors data, or link author in each books data

    Many to Many
    link on both sides, book has array and authors have array

    Questions to ask
    - How often does the embedded information get accessed?
    - Is the data queried using the embdded information
    - Does the mebedded information change often?
