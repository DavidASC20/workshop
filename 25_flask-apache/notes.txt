K25: Apache, Jump On It

(taken from Wen Hao's repo, still working on trying to fix it)
The flask app on apache seems to break if there isn't a "if __name__ == '__main__'" for the app.run() line

Adding the following lines to your wsgi file allows you to set the directory of your venv:
```
WSGIDaemonProcess <whatever> python-home=path/to/venv
WSGIProcessGroup <whatever>
WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
```
