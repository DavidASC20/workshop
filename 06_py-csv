#K06 Reading File and Finding Probability Based on Info In File
#2021-09-28
#Summary
#We first finished the file reader, and made it so that the file would be read where there would be the label and percentage.  We then wanted to make a random function that took the total and subtracted each percentage till it came to the value which would be the answer.
#Discoveries
#We discovered the weight parameter in random choices, which does weight automatically
